# Lab 1 : Introduction to Software Project Management (SPM) Using GitHub

This lab exercise aims to introduce students to Software Project Management (SPM) concepts by using **GitHub** to manage a software project. By the end of the exercise, students will have practical experience in creating and managing a project using GitHub tools such as **GitHub Projects**, **Issues**, **Milestones**, and **Pull Requests** to simulate the project management process.

---

#### **Lab Objective**
- Learn how to use GitHub for managing a software project.
- Understand the key concepts of SPM such as scope, task breakdown, scheduling, and risk management.
- Develop skills in creating and tracking issues, milestones, and tasks using GitHub Projects and Issues.

---

### **Lab Exercise Outline**

---

#### **Exercise 1: Setting Up a GitHub Repository**
In this exercise, you will create a GitHub repository to manage a software project.

1. **Create a New GitHub Repository**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository for your project.
   - Name the repository **"SIS-Project"** (or another software project of your choice).
   - Include a README file to describe the project, e.g., _"This repository contains the project management plan and code for the Student Information System (SIS) implementation at MSO University."_
   
2. **Initialize the Project Structure**:
   - Add folders such as `/docs`, `/src`, and `/tests` to organize your project files.
   - Create a `docs/project_charter.md` file and add the project charter information (Vision, Mission, Objectives, etc.).

   **Deliverable**: Share the link to your GitHub repository.

---

#### **Exercise 2: Defining the Project Scope Using GitHub Issues**
In this exercise, you will use GitHub **Issues** to define the project's scope by breaking down the project into tasks.

1. **Create GitHub Issues**:
   - Go to the **Issues** tab in your repository.
   - Create issues for each major deliverable of the project. Example:
     - Issue #1: Requirements Gathering
     - Issue #2: Software Development
     - Issue #3: Data Migration
     - Issue #4: Testing
     - Issue #5: Deployment
     - Issue #6: Training

2. **Add Detailed Task Descriptions**:
   - For each issue, provide a detailed description of what needs to be done. For example, under "Requirements Gathering," include tasks like meeting stakeholders and documenting requirements.
   
3. **Assign Team Members and Labels**:
   - Assign each issue to a team member and use labels like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed" to track progress.

   **Deliverable**: Submit a list of all GitHub issues created, including their descriptions and labels.

---

#### **Exercise 3: Creating a Project Plan Using GitHub Projects**
In this exercise, you will create a **GitHub Project Board** to track your project's progress.

1. **Set Up a GitHub Project**:
   - Go to the **Projects** tab and create a new project board for **SIS Implementation**.
   - Use the **Kanban** template to organize tasks into columns such as **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**.

2. **Add Issues to the Project Board**:
   - Add the issues you created in Exercise 2 to the project board by linking them to the appropriate columns (e.g., add "Requirements Gathering" to the **To Do** column).

3. **Track Progress**:
   - Move issues between the columns as the tasks progress (e.g., move "Software Development" from **In Progress** to **Done** when completed).

   **Deliverable**: Submit a screenshot of your GitHub Project board showing the tasks in different stages.

---

#### **Exercise 4: Creating and Managing Milestones**
Milestones help track the project schedule and ensure that key objectives are completed on time.

1. **Create Milestones**:
   - Go to the **Milestones** tab and create milestones for each major phase of the project. Example milestones:
     - Milestone 1: Requirements Gathering (Due Date: 2 weeks)
     - Milestone 2: Development (Due Date: 4 weeks)
     - Milestone 3: Data Migration (Due Date: 6 weeks)
     - Milestone 4: Testing (Due Date: 8 weeks)
     - Milestone 5: Deployment & Training (Due Date: 10 weeks)

2. **Link Issues to Milestones**:
   - Assign issues to the appropriate milestones. For example, link "Document Requirements" and "Meet with Stakeholders" to **Milestone 1** (Requirements Gathering).

   **Deliverable**: Submit a screenshot of your GitHub Milestones page, showing linked issues and due dates.

---

#### **Exercise 5: Tracking and Closing Issues with Pull Requests**
In this exercise, you will simulate the software development process by using GitHub **Pull Requests** (PR) to close issues.

1. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Make changes to the repository (e.g., update the `docs/requirements.md` file with documented requirements).
   - Open a **Pull Request** and link it to the corresponding issue (e.g., "Document Requirements").
   
2. **Review and Merge the Pull Request**:
   - Assign team members to review the PR. Once reviewed, merge the PR into the `main` branch.
   - Close the issue automatically by including **"Closes #issue-number"** in the PR description.

3. **Track the Progress**:
   - As each issue is closed, move it to the **Done** column in your GitHub Project board.

   **Deliverable**: Submit a screenshot of the merged pull request and the closed issue.

---

#### **Exercise 6: Risk Management with GitHub Issues**
Identifying and managing risks is crucial to project success.

1. **Create Risk Issues**:
   - Identify potential risks (e.g., data migration failure, delays in development) and create GitHub Issues to track them.
   - Use labels such as **Risk** to categorize these issues.

2. **Track Risk Resolution**:
   - For each risk issue, document the mitigation plan and update the issue as you take action to resolve it.

   **Deliverable**: Submit a list of risk issues created, including descriptions and mitigation plans.

---

### **Lab Exercise Wrap-Up**
By the end of this lab, students will:
- Set up and manage a project repository on GitHub.
- Use GitHub Issues to define tasks and track progress.
- Use GitHub Projects to visualize the project workflow.
- Manage milestones, pull requests, and risks using GitHub‚Äôs built-in tools.

This exercise demonstrates how GitHub can be a powerful tool for project management in software development projects, giving you hands-on experience with real-world project management techniques.
